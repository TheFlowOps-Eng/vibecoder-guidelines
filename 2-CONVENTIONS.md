# 2 — Conventions and tags

Rule numbers (e.g. **rule 9**) refer to the checker in `check/rules/`. "Error" fails CI; "warn" is reported but passes. The AI review rule ids (`ai-*`) refer to `check/ai/rules/`.

## 1. Architecture

From `@ohhwells/conventions` (installed in the starter under `node_modules/@ohhwells/conventions/`, loaded by its `CLAUDE.md`):

- **Section components receive content as typed props. They never fetch it, never import it, never hardcode it.** Literal display text, image URLs or link targets inside JSX belong in a content file.
- Content: one file per page in `src/content/<page>.ts`. Each section entry is `{ layout: '<key>' as const, content: { … } satisfies <LayoutContent> }`. The page resolves `XLayouts[content.x.layout].component` and renders it with `content` and a `sectionId`.
- Sections: `src/components/sections/<Type>/` with `<Type>.types.ts` (shared fields), `index.ts` (the layout registry, `{ key: { component, defaults } }`), and `layouts/<TypeLayout>/` holding `.tsx`, `.types.ts` (extends the shared type, never duplicates its fields), `.defaults.ts`, `.styles.css`.
- Layout keys come from `node_modules/@ohhwells/conventions/templates/layout-archetypes.md`. Do not invent keys. Shared fields of an archetype must stay as defined; if a layout needs more (a CTA, an image), add them as **optional** fields on the layout's own type, which is what the starter's `CTACentered` does.
- **Start a new section from the starter's own sections** (`starter/src/components/sections/*` in this repo, or the same folder in your copy): they carry every tag this document requires. The package's `templates/reference-layouts/` are structure-only: no `data-ohw-*` attributes, no `sectionId` prop, raw `<img>`. If you copy one, you tag it from scratch following §2–§5. (The `ohhwells-scaffold` CLI mentioned in that package's docs is not shipped in version 1.0.2.)
- Adding a section to a page whose content type lives in `src/types/content.ts`: extend that page's type with a `{ layout, content }` entry and add the data in `src/content/<page>.ts`; the page passes `content` and a `sectionId`.
- App Router only (`src/app/`). No `pages/`.
- No hardcoded colours or font names where a token exists (see §8).

---

## 2. Editable elements

Both attributes on the **same element** (**rule 1**, error; a key applied through a conditional spread is a warn — it is unkeyed on the falsy branch).

```tsx
<h1 data-ohw-editable="text" data-ohw-key="hero-headline" data-ohw-max-length="80">{content.headline}</h1>
```

Modes the bridge understands (**rule 3**: anything else is an error and is coerced to rich text at runtime):

| `data-ohw-editable` | Put it on | What the owner / AI can do |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | any text element | rewrite with inline formatting (bold, italic, alignment, lists) |
| `plain` | any text element | rewrite text only; saves `innerText` |
| `image` | `<img>` / Next `<Image>` | replace `src` |
| `bg-image` | a container styled with `backgroundImage` | replace the background URL |
| `video` | `<video>` | replace `src`; autoplay/mute persist under derived keys `<key>__ohw_autoplay` / `<key>__ohw_muted` |
| `icon` | a `<span>` wrapping an inline SVG or glyph | swap the glyph (sized to the slot, colour via `currentColor`) |
| `map` | a Google-Maps `<iframe>` + `data-ohw-map-query` | rewrite the address (§10) |
| `form` | `<form>` | field/success editing through the form toolbar (§9) |
| `link` | — | accepted by the bridge, but links are authored with `data-ohw-href-key` (§5), not this mode |

Guidance:

- `text` for headlines, subheads and body copy. `plain` for single-word micro-labels (eyebrows, names, roles) where pasted formatting would break the layout. Link labels must be `text` (§5). (`ai-mode-choice`, info.)
- `data-ohw-max-length="N"` shows a live counter in the editor. Headlines 60–80, subheads 120–160, body: omit.
- **Array-rendered content** (paragraphs split from one string, mapped list items): tag the **wrapper**, not each child. See `AboutSplit.tsx` (`about-body`).
- **Never nest an editable inside a `text` or `plain` editable** (**rule 4**, error): the outer one writes `innerHTML` and wipes the inner one. A `bg-image` or `image` container holding editable text is fine.
- **Key every image** (**rule 5**, warn): an unkeyed `<img>`/`<Image>` is invisible to the AI and unavailable to generated sections. Images inside an `image`/`bg-image`/`icon` editable are exempt.
- Do not rely on inline `style` on the editable element for text content; the editor saves and restores `innerHTML`. CSS classes are fine.
- Editables the bridge owns inside a React component that re-renders (state, timers, animation frames) get reset by React. Memoize the element (`useMemo`) or keep it out of the re-rendering subtree. (`ai-rerender-wipes-editables`, warn.)

---

## 3. Keys

- kebab-case (**rule 2**, warn otherwise). Scheme: `{section}-{field}`; list items `{section}-item-{i}-{field}` (`services-item-${i}-title`).
- **Stored content is one flat map per site, keyed by `data-ohw-key`.** There is no per-page scoping. Two elements with the same key, on the same page or on different pages, always show the same stored value; editing one edits the other. So keys must be **unique across the whole site** (**rule 2**, error). The one deliberate exception: the desktop navbar and the mobile drawer share their keys so both stay in step, and the checker excuses duplicates when both files are chrome (§6).
- **Rule 2 only compares literal keys.** A computed key (`` `${sectionId}-title` ``) is skipped as "unique by construction". That is true only if you make it true: the checker cannot tell you that a section component with **literal** keys (`services-item-${i}-title`) rendered on two pages puts both placements on one stored value.
- **A section component placed on more than one page** therefore has to choose: derive every key (and `ohwKey`) from the `sectionId` prop (`` `${sectionId}-item-${i}-title` ``) so each placement is edited independently, or keep literal keys only when both placements are meant to be the same content. Decide it; do not inherit it. `{section}` in the scheme above means the placement id in the first case and the section type in the second.
- **Stable forever.** Renaming a key, href-key or section id orphans every saved owner edit under the old name and the live site reverts to template defaults for it. Treat any rename as a data-loss event. (`ai-key-rename-data-loss`, warn.)
- **Dynamic routes** (**rule 22**, error): a file under `[slug]/` renders once per URL but content is stored per key. Every `data-ohw-key`, `data-ohw-href-key`, `data-ohw-section`, `ohwKey` and `sectionId` in such a file must be an expression that mentions the route param (`team-bio-${member.slug}-name`). A literal or an index-only key (`${i}`) is one shared value across every page of the route. Shared components used by dynamic pages must derive their keys from the `sectionId` prop rather than hardcoding a prefix.
- Never author keys starting with `__ohw_` (**rule 17**, error).

---

## 4. Sections

Every top-level section root carries both attributes (**rule 9**: missing label is a warn; non-kebab id is a warn):

```tsx
<section data-ohw-section={sectionId} data-ohw-section-label="Services">
```

- The attribute is `data-ohw-section`. `data-ohw-section-container` is a different, bridge-injected attribute; never write it.
- Ids are the anchors for section-scoped prompts, generate/delete/style targeting, reorder and style overrides. Two pages reporting the same id are **one section** to the editor: styling either restyles both.
- Therefore a section component takes a **`sectionId` prop** and each page passes a unique one (`<Hero sectionId="home-hero" …/>`). **Rule 9** errors when: the same `sectionId="literal"` is passed on two or more pages; a component under `sections/`, `layout/`, `site/` or `ui/` hardcodes `data-ohw-section="x"` and is rendered by two or more pages; or it falls back with `sectionId ?? 'x'` and two or more pages pass nothing.
- Header and footer sections are named **exactly** `navbar` and `footer` (**rule 10**, error otherwise). They are shared site-wide on purpose, are undeletable, and survive whole-page AI generation. `global-navbar`/`global-footer` are tolerated by the id-collision check only; use the exact names.
- **Every editable sits inside a section** (**rule 11**, warn; checked in `page.tsx` and `layout.tsx`, where "no section ancestor in this file" means none at all). An editable outside any `data-ohw-section` silently widens every prompt on it to whole-page scope. A landmark (`header`/`nav`/`footer`/`aside`) or a component receiving a `sectionId=` prop counts as a section root.
- Labels are what the owner sees in the section list and what the model receives as the section name. Missing label ⇒ title-cased id. Two placements of the same layout may share a label ("Team" on both pages); only the ids must differ. One section per region a user would point at and say "restyle that"; no ids on trivial wrappers. (`ai-section-granularity`, info.)
- Section soft-delete, order and duplication (`__ohw_section_order`, `data-ohw-section-removed`, `data-ohw-instance`, `::<instanceId>` key suffixes) are bridge-managed. Author nothing.

---

## 5. Links and roles

Destination on the anchor, label on an inner span, label mode **`text`**:

```tsx
<Link href={item.href} data-ohw-href-key={`nav-${i}-href`}>
  <span data-ohw-editable="text" data-ohw-key={`nav-${i}-label`}>{item.label}</span>
</Link>
```

- A `plain` label under an href-keyed link is an error (**rule 6**): the bridge only recognises a link as a nav item when its label is `text`. Logo roots and social links are exempt (they carry no text label).
- **Tag every nav and footer menu item**, not just the CTA (**rule 7**, warn, chrome files): a link without `data-ohw-href-key` cannot be seen or rewired by the AI and cannot be reordered. Pure `href="#…"` anchors, logos and socials are exempt.
- Two classes of link, decided by what the element is:
  - **Reorderable items** — nav menu links, footer column links (inside `data-ohw-footer-col`), socials. Href-key only, **no role**; a role would break reorder.
  - **Fixed links** — section CTAs, pricing buttons, legal links, back-to-top, inline body links, tel/mailto contact links. Trio: `data-ohw-href-key` + `data-ohw-role="button"` + `data-ohw-drag-disabled="true"`. Without the role the bridge gives the link drag/duplicate/delete machinery. **Rule 23** (error) flags href-keyed links with no role in non-chrome files; inside chrome files the call is the AI review's (`ai-link-affordance-intent`, warn).
- The starter's `Button` renders the trio for you: `<Button href={content.ctaHref} ohwKey="hero-cta">` ⇒ `hero-cta-href` on the link, `data-ohw-role="button"`, `data-ohw-drag-disabled="true"`, and `<span data-ohw-editable="text" data-ohw-key="hero-cta-label">`. Omit `ohwKey` for submit/onClick buttons.
- Header CTA: `data-ohw-role="navbar-button"` + `data-ohw-drag-disabled="true"` (**rule 8** warns when the pair is incomplete). Logo root: `data-ohw-role="logo"`.
- **At least one `button`/`navbar-button` role must exist in the template** (**rule 8**, error): `update_style` alignment finds the button's row through it and generated sections derive the template's button radius from it. No `logo` role is a warn. Roles emitted from an object spread (`{'data-ohw-role': 'button'}`) count.
- Generated hrefs are allowlisted to the site's real page paths and `#anchors`; internal links should use real routes.

---

## 6. Navbar and footer chrome

"Chrome files" to the checker: anything under `components/layout/` or a file named `Navbar|Nav|MobileMenu|MobileNav|Footer|Menu.tsx`.

- Keep the starter's markup hooks exactly as shipped; the bridge reads all of them: `data-ohw-nav-root`, `data-ohw-nav-container`, `data-ohw-nav-group`, `data-ohw-nav-children`, `data-ohw-nav-caret`, `data-ohw-nav-open`, `data-ohw-nav-drawer` (mobile), `data-ohw-footer-links`, `data-ohw-footer-col="<n>"`, `data-ohw-socials-row`, `data-ohw-wordmark`. `NavDropdownTemplate` (a hidden `data-ohw-nav-dropdown-template` group) is the clone source the bridge copies when the owner creates a dropdown; keep it in both the navbar and the mobile drawer.
- Desktop navbar and mobile drawer render the same keys (`nav-${i}-href` / `nav-${i}-label`, `nav-cta-href` / `nav-cta-label`) on purpose; both carry `data-ohw-section="navbar"`.
- Logo (`Wordmark.tsx`): anchor with `data-ohw-role="logo"` + `data-ohw-href-key="nav-logo-href"` (+ `data-ohw-placeholder=""` while the name is a placeholder), containing `<img data-ohw-editable="image" data-ohw-key="nav-logo-image">` and `<span data-ohw-editable="plain" data-ohw-key="nav-logo-text" data-ohw-wordmark="">`. Footer mirrors it with `footer-logo-href`, `footer-logo`, `footer-logo-text`. Do not add a `src` to the logo `<img>` unless the content provides one; the bridge sets it for uploads.
- Footer keys in the starter: `footer-tagline`, `footer-0-heading`, `footer-0-${i}-href` / `-label`, `footer-social-${i}-href` / `-label`, `footer-copyright`.

---

## 7. Socials

Socials are **inferred**, not declared with a mode. The bridge treats a link as a social when either:

- its `data-ohw-href-key` contains a `social`/`socials` segment or a platform-name segment (`instagram`, `facebook`, `fb`, `linkedin`, `twitter`, `tiktok`, `youtube`, `threads`, `whatsapp`, `telegram`, `pinterest`, `snapchat`, `discord`, `behance`, `dribbble`, `vimeo`, `spotify`, `github`, `reddit`, `medium`, `twitch`), or
- the anchor contains exactly one `data-ohw-editable="icon"` element.

Requirements: actually **render** the socials from content (declared-but-unrendered socials are invisible to the editor and the AI); wrap the row in `data-ohw-socials-row`; give each link its own href-key following the scheme above; put the glyph in an editable `icon` span and keep the template's own drawings (the bridge only swaps glyphs when the owner picks one). Order and icon/text display are bridge-managed (`__ohw_socials_order`, `__ohw_socials_display`).

---

## 8. Brand and colour tokens

Three tiers, all read at runtime:

1. `--ohw-brand-*` (`primary`, `accent`, `light`, `dark`, `surface`, `border`, `muted`) — written by the bridge on `<html>` when a brand override applies. **Never define these.**
2. `--brand-*` — the template contract. Required (**rule 12**, error if any is never defined): `--brand-primary`, `--brand-accent`, `--brand-background`, `--brand-text`, `--brand-surface`, `--brand-border`, `--brand-font-heading`, `--brand-font-body`. The starter also emits `--brand-text-muted`, `--brand-on-primary`, `--brand-secondary` and more.
3. `--color-*` / `--font-*` — baked tokens that generated AI sections and the scheduling widget read. Required (**rule 14**, warn): `--color-primary`, `--color-accent`, `--font-body`, `--font-display`. The starter also emits `--color-light`, `--color-dark`, `--radius`, `--fs-section-h2`, `--font-weight-heading`.

Each brand colour is emitted as the override-with-fallback chain (**rule 13**, error if no source contains `var(--ohw-brand-`); `BrandProvider.tsx` does this from `content/brand.ts`:

```
--brand-primary: var(--ohw-brand-primary, #0F0F0F);
```

- Route **all** component CSS through `--brand-*` (colour) and `--brand-font-heading` / `--brand-font-body` (type). A hex literal in CSS is a warn (**rule 12**) unless it sits inside a `var(--x, #fallback)` on the same line. Comment lines are ignored.
- Fonts are **loaded** in `src/lib/fonts.ts` (`next/font`) and **named** in `content/brand.ts`. Changing one without the other leaves the browser on the fallback family.
- Surfaces styled with literals or private token ramps stay fixed when the owner changes their brand; that is a bug unless the surface is deliberately neutral (image-backed hero, monochrome footer). (`ai-brand-var-dead-routing`, warn.)
- **Card components carry the bare `card` class token** (**rule 15**, warn): the corner-style rule targets `:is(.card, [data-ohw-card])`. `card-sticker`-style names do not match. The starter's `Card.tsx` does this.
- Keep the brand kit complete: the editor only sends the current brand to the AI when the full `{ palette: { dark, primary, accent, light }, fonts: { heading, body } }` shape resolves. In the starter these come from `content/brand.ts` (`text` → dark, `background` → light).

---

## 9. Forms

Ship the minimal contract; the bridge does the rest at page load:

```tsx
<form data-ohw-editable="form" data-ohw-key="contact-form">
  <Input name="email" placeholder="Your email" type="email" required />
  <Button type="submit">Send</Button>
</form>
```

- The form needs its key (**rule 1**): without one the bridge never submits it.
- Every data input/textarea/select has a **`name`** (**rule 16**, error): the bridge keys fields by name; unnamed fields get an unstable generated key. `type="submit|button|hidden|reset"` are exempt.
- Do not tag inputs; do not author labels. The bridge injects `data-ohw-form-field`, `data-ohw-field-type` and a `<label data-ohw-field-label data-ohw-key="<field>-label">` per field, on plain page load as well as in the editor. Those injected keys are how AI style prompts reach form fields.
- Placeholder-only designs (pill newsletter forms, sr-only labels): the injected label would break the layout. Guard with CSS scoped to that form: `.my-form [data-ohw-field-label] { display: none !important; }`. Never "fix" it by unkeying. (`ai-form-label-visual-damage`, warn.)
- Reserved derived keys: `<formKey>-fields`, `<formKey>-success`. Do not collide with them.

---

## 10. Maps

The address is the editable value. Build `src` and `data-ohw-map-query` from the same string:

```tsx
const address = content.address;
<iframe
  data-ohw-editable="map"
  data-ohw-key="contact-map"
  data-ohw-map-query={address}
  src={`https://www.google.com/maps?q=${encodeURIComponent(address)}&output=embed`}
/>
```

- `map` without `data-ohw-map-query` is an error (**rule 3**).
- A key naming a map (`…-map`, `map-…`) with any other mode is an error, and any string literal in source shaped like `[… map …]` (placeholder copy standing in for a map) is an error (**rule 21**). Ship a real embed or nothing.

---

## 11. Carousels

Contract from the bridge's `docs/editable-carousels.md`, enforced mechanically by **rule 24**:

```tsx
'use client';
import { useOhwCarousel } from '@ohhwells/bridge';

export function Gallery({ content }) {
  const { images, bind } = useOhwCarousel('studio-gallery', content.images);
  return (
    <div {...bind}>
      {images.map((img, i) => (
        <div key={i} data-ohw-carousel-slide={i}>
          <Image src={img.src} alt={img.alt} fill unoptimized />
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

- `'use client'` at the top (error), `{...bind}` spread on the slide container (error), a unique kebab-case key (duplicate = error, non-kebab = warn), `data-ohw-carousel-slide={i}` on each slide (warn if absent from the file).
- Render from `images` (the hook's array), **never** the raw prop; otherwise edits save but never show. (`ai-carousel-contract-intent`, warn.)
- No `.slice(0, n)` on the list (warn); the layout must handle any count because add/delete is supported.
- `next/image` slides need `unoptimized` (warn): uploaded slides come from hosts outside `next.config`.
- Items are `{ src, alt }` only; extra fields are dropped on the first edit. v1 supports replace/add/delete/alt; no reordering, images only.
- Slides carry **no** per-image `data-ohw-editable`; the carousel owns them. Two projections of one list (background stack + thumbnail rail): only the primary container takes `{...bind}`.
- Manual form without the hook: container stamped with `data-ohw-carousel`, `data-ohw-key` (error if missing) and `data-ohw-carousel-value={JSON.stringify(images)}` (warn if missing).

---

## 12. Video, icons, multi-state, scheduling

- **Video**: `<video data-ohw-editable="video" data-ohw-key="hero-video">`. Autoplay/mute state rides the derived keys listed in §2.
- **Icons**: `<span data-ohw-editable="icon" data-ohw-key="services-item-0-icon"><svg …/></span>`. The span owns its glyph; an `<img>` inside it needs no separate key.
- **Multi-state blocks** (form success/error views): `data-ohw-editable-state="default,success"` on the container, `data-ohw-state-view="success"` on each state wrapper.
- **Scheduling**: mount the bridge's `SchedulingWidget` (exported from `@ohhwells/bridge`). It renders its own `data-ohw-section="scheduling-*"` and reads your `--color-*` / `--brand-*` tokens. No other authoring.

---

## 13. Reserved namespace — never author

**Rule 17** (error) flags all of these:

- Keys starting with `__ohw_`.
- Attributes: `data-ohw-instance`, `data-ohw-section-removed`, `data-ohw-ai-generated`, `data-ohw-ai-removed`, `data-ohw-ai-replaced-by`, `data-ohw-ai-template-hidden`, `data-ai-section`, `data-ohw-card`, `data-ohw-section-container`, `data-ohw-selected`, `data-ohw-hovered`, `data-ohw-editing`, `data-ohw-social-item`, `data-ohw-placeholder-edit`, `data-ohw-empty-label`, `data-ohw-can-drag`, `data-ohw-item-dragging`, `data-ohw-footer-press-drag`.
- Whole families by prefix: `data-ohw-style-*`, `data-ohw-field-*`, `data-ohw-form-*`.

Dual-purpose attributes you **do** author, for their documented purpose only: `data-ohw-socials-row`, `data-ohw-footer-col`, `data-ohw-map-query`, `data-ohw-placeholder` (logo placeholder state, via the Wordmark pattern).

---

## 14. Plumbing

**Rule 18** on `src/app/layout.tsx`: the file exists (error); it loads the bridge styles via `import '@ohhwells/bridge/styles'` or a synced static `ohhwells-bridge.css` link (error); `<OhhwellsBridge />` is wrapped in `<Suspense>` (error); the `#ohw-loader` first-paint loader is present (warn).

**Rule 19**: `.env.example` exists and mentions `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLOWOPS_API_URL` (warn).

**Rule 20**: `@ohhwells/bridge` is a dependency (error) and its exact pin matches the newest pin across the repo (warn). The pin is the AI feature gate; keep it current and redeploy after bumps.

---
